All your ages are present—the fierce child, the faithful youth, the achieving adult, the healing heart. Return to any era that calls you, not to regress but to reclaim and integrate.

Some of these visions are snares set by your enemies; others are distractions from your true desire. Choose with your gut, not your greed.',
    traditional: 'Beware the temptations that masquerade as visions, faithful one. Not every shimmering promise comes from the Divine—some are sent to test or mislead you. Measure each choice against the teachings. That which contradicts sacred law, however beautiful, is illusion. Seek counsel from those wiser in discernment.',
    modern: 'Multiple options present—avoid analysis paralysis and fantasy thinking. Which of these choices have viable paths to execution? Apply due diligence: market research, feasibility analysis, resource requirements. Dreams without actionable plans are distractions. Select the opportunity with the best probability-weighted outcome.',
    postModern: 'These visions arise from your psyche—all of them are you, speaking in symbols. Do not judge them as temptations but explore them as messages. What do these fantasies reveal about unmet needs, shadow desires, unlived possibilities? Imagination is the soul\'s language. Listen before you choose.',
    metaModern: 'What a spectacular display the psyche offers! Each cup is a possibility, a shadow, a projection, a genuine option—and you cannot know which is which until you engage. The wizard neither grasps nor dismisses but holds all visions lightly, letting deeper knowing sort signal from noise. The choice will clarify through attention.',

The mystics walked into deserts seeking the Divine. If your soul calls you onward, go with blessing, but carry the teachings with you. The tradition travels in your heart.',

The journey inward requires releasing what no longer fits your becoming. What you seek cannot be found in what you already have. Walk toward yourself.',
    metaModern: 'This departure contains the dragon seeking greater glory, the pilgrim seeking deeper truth, the strategist reallocating resources, and the soul seeking itself.

    traditional: 'You are caught between competing duties, faithful one. When two paths seem equally right, seek the wisdom of scripture and elder counsel. The blindfold suggests you are relying too much on your own understanding—remove it through prayer and meditation. The proper choice will align with eternal law.',
    modern: 'Decision deadlock—you need more data or a better framework. Remove the blindfold of emotional interference and assess objectively. If both options test equally, you need different evaluation criteria. Set a deadline; the cost of indecision is measurable. Sometimes progress requires choosing imperfectly and iterating.',
    postModern: 'The blindfold is there because some truths are too painful to face. What are you protecting yourself from knowing? This impasse holds wisdom—perhaps the dilemma is false, or perhaps you are not yet ready. Sit with the discomfort. The heart knows things the mind defends against. Let feeling inform the thinking.',
    metaModern: 'What if the blindfold is also a gift? Sometimes we must choose without complete seeing. The instincts, the tradition, the data, the heart—each blade contains partial truth. The metamodern move is neither to force decision nor to paralyze indefinitely but to hold the tension until something new emerges. Trust the process of not-yet-knowing.',

    traditional: 'This sorrow pierces deep, but suffering has sacred purpose in the divine economy. The heart that breaks open can receive more grace. Seek comfort in the rituals of mourning your tradition provides—they exist because others have walked this path before. Pain shared with the faithful is pain diminished.',
    modern: 'Painful truth received—process it efficiently. Denial is expensive; better to integrate difficult information quickly than to let it fester. This data changes your model of reality; update accordingly. The faster you metabolize hard truths, the sooner you can recalculate and move forward strategically.',
    postModern: 'This heartbreak is valid and real; let it be witnessed without fixing. Grief is not a problem to solve but an experience to move through with companions. Who can hold space for your sorrow? The heart that breaks is the heart that loved. That capacity for love remains, even through the pain.',
    metaModern: 'The pierced heart holds all the responses to pain—the forging, the sacred suffering, the efficient processing, the witnessed grief. You do not need to choose one way to hurt.

Use this downtime for reflection and planning. Mental maintenance is an investment in future productivity. Return to action refreshed and with enhanced clarity.',
    postModern: 'Rest is not earned through exhaustion; it is your birthright. The constant demand to produce is a cultural wound, not a virtue. Let yourself simply be, without justification. In stillness, the psyche integrates what activity cannot process. This sanctuary is not escape but essential return to self.',

The righteous warrior fights with honor, for the manner of winning matters as much as victory itself. Seek reconciliation where the rules permit.',

Assess whether your tactics served short-term ego or long-term success. Reputation is a strategic asset; calculate accordingly.',

Victory built on another\'s diminishment is hollow for everyone. Consider what collaborative outcome might have served all voices.',

Accept the guidance of those who ferry you; they serve a sacred purpose. Calmer waters await where you can rebuild according to proper form.',

The calm waters ahead offer better conditions for your next venture. Sometimes the winning move is changing the game board.',

The troubled waters behind taught something, even through pain. Gentler shores await, but do not rush the passage. The journey itself is part of the healing.',

    traditional: 'Beware the path of cunning, for it often leads away from righteousness. The ends do not justify means that violate sacred law. If you must be strategic, let your strategy serve the greater good, not mere personal gain. The Divine sees all—what is hidden from others is never hidden from above.',
    modern: 'Unconventional tactics may be required—asymmetric strategy has its place. But calculate reputational risk carefully. Short-term gains from clever maneuvers can create long-term liabilities. In transparent markets, information travels fast. Ensure your methods can withstand disclosure.',
    postModern: 'Something needs reclaiming that cannot be asked for directly—perhaps your own power, your own truth. Not all stealth is deception; sometimes it is protection from systems that would deny your needs. But examine: who is harmed if you proceed this way? Cleverness used for liberation differs from exploitation.',
    metaModern: 'The trickster archetype holds its own developmental path—sometimes cunning serves evolution when direct confrontation cannot. The question is not whether to be clever but what cleverness serves. When strategy, ethics, self-protection, and systemic awareness align, the unconventional path may be the most integral one.',

Sometimes we cage ourselves through rigid interpretation rather than faithful understanding. Seek guidance from those who know the tradition deeply—there may be pathways within the law you have not seen.',
    modern: 'Constraint analysis required—which limitations are real and which are assumed? Test your hypotheses about what is impossible. Many barriers are mental models, not market realities. Hire a coach or consultant with fresh eyes. Innovation often comes from questioning the constraints everyone else accepts.',
    postModern: 'These bonds were placed by systems, beliefs, and stories you did not choose. Some are internalized oppression, not personal failure. What voices told you that you were trapped? Whose interests does your captivity serve? Liberation often requires community—others can see the exit you cannot. Ask for help.',
    metaModern: 'The bindings are simultaneously self-created, systemically imposed, strategically testable, and requiring collective liberation—all true.

Light your candle, speak the old prayers, clutch the sacred symbols close. Dawn follows darkness by divine decree. You are never as alone as fear whispers.',
