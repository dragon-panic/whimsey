The infinite lemniscate above her head shows this is not personal power but cosmic force flowing through her.",jungian:"Strength represents the integration of the beast—the Shadow in its most primal form approached not with suppression or projection but with loving awareness.

The Hermit's solitude is a privilege—the time and safety to withdraw from the demands of others requires resources not everyone possesses.

Inner work in service of nothing beyond itself can become spiritual narcissism.",metaModern:"The Hermit holds the wizard's solitude, the mystic's communion, the analyst's depth, and the servant's accountability—ascending alone while remaining connected to the human web below.

What is weighed in the balance of eternity?",modern:"Justice represents systemic accountability—the processes, audits, and balancing mechanisms that keep organizations honest. Good governance requires both the sword (decisive action) and the scales (fair measurement). Build systems where outcomes are tracked, where equity is measured, where the data tells the story that preferences might suppress. Sustainable excellence requires honest evaluation.",postModern:"Justice must be interrogated: who designed these scales? Every legal system reflects the values of those who built it. True justice requires examining who benefits from the current balance, who has been systematically underweighted, what voices have been silenced by the sword. Restorative justice includes repairing harm to those the scales have failed. The balance must include everyone.",metaModern:"Justice holds the sword of fierce truth and the scales of compassionate balance simultaneously.

While lesser souls flee from endings, you dive into the heart of transformation and emerge changed—more dangerous than before. Every death in your life has refined you, stripped away what weakened you, left only what cannot be destroyed. You are not afraid of the pale horse. You ride it.",traditional:"Death's card is the thirteenth—the number of transformation in the sacred numerology, the number of the lunar cycle complete.
